# Othogonal_Arrays
This repository contains code related to performing operations on orthogonal arrays. Orthogonal arrays are essential in experimental design for efficiently studying the effects of multiple factors with varying levels. They ensure that all possible combinations of factor levels are evenly and systematically tested.
